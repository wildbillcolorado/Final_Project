# How to generate a website for your repo

To generate a website, simply copy the HTML (or `.md` markdown) files you want to make publicly available into your `docs` folder and include links to the different files in the `index.md` file. To then make the contents of the `docs` directory publicly available (works both in private and public repos!): go to your repository settings and scroll down to `Github Pages` and select `master branch /docs folder` in the `Source` dropdown (this will not affect the rest of your repository, only the `docs` folder, the rest will stay private unless you make the entire repository public). The page will reload and when you scroll back down to the `Github Pages` settings it will show you at what web address the contents of your docs directory will be available (for example, https://GITHUBUSER.github.io/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME/). Please note that it usually takes a few minutes for the page to be ready when you first switch this on so check back later if the page does not load immediately.
